Installation
============

To use extension, just add ``buildout.bootstrap`` to the [buildout] section of
your ``buildout.cfg``::

    [buildout]
    extensions =
        ...
        buildout.bootstrap

Now whenever you run Buildout this extension will add or update your
buildout's bootstrap.py file, leaving you free to do other more important
things: like write, test, and deploy your code!
