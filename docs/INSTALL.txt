Installation
============

To use extension, just add ``buildout.bootstrap`` to the [buildout] section of
your ``buildout.cfg``::

    [buildout]
    extensions =
        ...
        buildout.bootstrap

Now whenever you run Buildout this extension will add or update your
buildout's bootstrap.py file, leaving you free to do other more important
things: like write, test, and deploy your code!

Options
=======

You can specify in which version ``zc.buildout`` you want to look for the 
bootstrap.py file (trunk by default)::

    [buildout]
    extensions = buildout.bootstrap

    [bootstrap]
    version = 1.0.0

This is normally not necessary, but in the event trunk breaks one day (which
has happened) then you can specify the last known good version.
