Introduction
============

``buildout.bootstrap`` is a zc.buildout extension that adds a zc.buildout
``bootstrap.py`` file to your buildout.

It satisfies the use case of::

    "I want to keep my buildout's bootstrap.py file up to date 
    without having to manually download it from svn.zope.org." 

It also makes it possible (and easy) to add a bootstrap.py file to a buildout created
via the command: ``buildout init``. 

With this extension, you can avoid having to type::

    % wget http://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py

Just add a new extension called ``buildout.bootstrap`` to the buildout section
of your Buildout configuration file::

    [buildout]
    extensions = 
        â€¦
        buildout.bootstrap

Now whenever you run Buildout this extension will add or update your
buildout's bootstrap.py file, leaving you free to do other more important
things: like write, test, and deploy your code!
